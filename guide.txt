n Windows: just run  devrialem.exe file in "src" folder
In Linux: you must run linux_setup_executable_form.sh but before run this file you should do this instructions:
$ sudo chmod +x linux_setup_executable_form.sh 
and then:
$ ./linux_setup_executable_form.sh
after that you can run the devrialem LSB executable with this commands:
$ cd src
$ ./devrialem

P.S: You are need Python 3.9 version or higher for run. (I am not sure for version it'll be lower but i start development at 3.9.5 and finished with 3.10.5) :D!
